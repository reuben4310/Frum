             The time of your Bar Mitzvah is very important. It is when you are considered ready, beruchnius, to keep the entire Torah and mitzvos. 

  

 

Before the time of a Bar Mitzvah, a boy is still considered a Na’ar, a youth. He is not responsible for any mitzvos, except in a way of Chinuch, educational learning. For example, even though you are not mechuyav in kiddush until you are Bar Mitzvah, you have probably said it many times. This is because you were learning and practicing fot the “big game.” If keeping Torah and mitzvos during the years before a Bar Mitzvah is considered playing the little leagues, a Bar Mitzvah bochur is like an All Star player! 

 

 

 Together with the readiness beruchnius for all the important jobs of a boy who is Bar Mitzvah, like being part of a minyan or putting on teffilin, come the changes that start happening begashmius which change a boy’s body from that of a child to an adult. The mitzvah of getting married, for example, requires an adult body. 

 You may already know about many of these changes, or you may be learning about them for the first time. These changes are called puberty and they can begin to happen any time between the ages 10 to 15. 

 Binogaia our topic, yes that is the natural ages it can happen, but for most boys it starts anywhere from 12 to 13 1/2. 

 This is also referred to as the time of adolescence. Puberty may take a few years and sometimes longer. One bochur might grow a full beard in the time it takes for another bochur to just begin sprouting mustache hairs! 

 The time of puberty can be challenging, so being prepared can help you. It is important to understand and take care of your body, as well as to have people who can support you when you need them. Being close and open with your parents, having good friends and a rav who you can speak to are good tools for you to use as you go through these changes. 

 You may be excited, nervous, confused or uncomfortable with all the changes that are happening. It can be helpful to remember that everyone goes through it (even your parents and friends!), and it is a challenging time for everyone. Everything that you are experiencing is normal and just another part of growing up. 

 Wishing you much hatzlacha! 

 Now let’s bring the first part of the conversation, from Rabbi Peysin’s book, which he has under the section titled: PUBIC CHANGES: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The scrotum (pouch of skin containing the testicles, Beyim), and the Beyim themselves will grow. It will grow larger, coarser, and darker. The Beyim will hang loosely down. Usually this occurs first, followed by growth of the Milah, which will become longer and thicker. 

 This is one of the most important changes which will happen, and has the potential for the most kedusha. 

 When a baby is born, males and females are generally identical except for one organ – one body part; the milah. In English, the milah is known as the penis. 

 The very first mitzvah that you did was with your milah, having a Bris Milah. The tip of the milah used to be covered by a thick piece of skin, the orlah, known as the foreskin. 

 At a bris, the thick skin is removed to reveal a softer more sensitive area of the milah. In a way, this refers to revealing a more refined part of the neshamah, making of more receptive and open to Hashem, Torah and Yiddishkeit. 

 

 The milah is actually a very holy body part. In fact, according to the Zohar, before Adam Harishon did the Cheit Eitz Hadaas, a special light shone from the area of his milah. He was not ashamed of it. Cheit Eitz Hadaas caused  

him to feel uncomfortable with the private parts of his body, and he covered it. 

 -See Zohar Aleph in the Hashmatos 16b, gimmel 306b. “Adam’s heel (referring to his milah) dulled the orb of the sun.”- 

 

 The milah is the body part that is used as part of the process of having children. During puberty, the milah is preparing for its important job. -Yes, as we have mention in the beginning of this publication, this happens during puberty, not when, you’re a Chassan. – You make think that you’re a little young to be preparing for having children, but the chiyuv of marriage actually begins at Bar Mitzvah, along with other mitzvos! -Like Pirya V’Rivya. According to most Rishonim, marriage and Pirya V’Rivya, are two different Mitzvos. – Nowadays we don’t actually get married at this age, because we are busy studying Torah and preparing for marriage. 

 So far in your life, you probably knew of only one thing that come from your milah, urine, also referred to as Ketanim – the waist fluids that your body gets rid of when you use the bathroom. 

 However the milah is also the place that the Zera, semen, comes from. The word Zera literally means “seeds.” Imagine that creating a new baby was like planting something. A new plant needs lot of things to grow, like good soil, water and sunlight. The Zera of a male is like the seed that is planted for a new baby to grow.  

 The word Zera is also used to mean “offspring” or the children that a person has, because that is what the Zera accomplishes. For example, we give people a brachah to have “Zar’a Chaya V’kayama,” “living and enduring children.” 

  

 

 

Zera is actually a combination of “sperm,” which are microscopic cells -which when you look at it with a medical microscope, you can actually see body organs, like hands and feet, etc.- and fluid. The zera appears to be a whitish, yellowish fluid that is somewhat thick and it comes out in the amount of about a teaspoon or more. 

 I think what he means is that everyman a male ejaculates, the zera comes out in the amount of about a teaspoon or more, at a time, not that that is the full ejaculation. 

 Zera is produced by the Beyim, testicles, which are enclosed in the scrotum with hangs beneath the milah. 

 

 The task of zera is very valuable (it creates new Yiddishe children!), and this is one important reason we are very careful not to waste any of it. When Zera is wasted, even by accident, it is called Zera Levatalah, “wasted seeds.”  

 Imagine if you were carrying a little handful of very rare and important seeds that were going to be used to plant a special fruit tree in the royal palace gardens. You certainly would be very careful not to spill or waste any of them! This topic will be discussed at length later. 

 And yes, we will be bringing down that section as well. 

 More frequently during puberty, the milah becomes hard. This happenes when blood rushes to that area, and causes what is called an erection, known as Kishui (hardness, from the word kasheh). Because of the hormones of puberty, this may happen by itself, but a bochur must take care not to cause it to happen deliberately.  

 Remember, this a very important part of the conversation. But as we have discussed in the first chapter. It should only come from a place of love. 

 We will discuss some details and practical tips on this later. 

 Yes, he means the section that he wrote about before, which we said we will be bringing down. 

 Now Rabbi Peysin’s next section is not as Nogeia for our conversation, but it is at least somewhat Nogeia, and it does give us a bit more of understanding, and it’s right after the previous section, that we bought down, in “His” book, so let’s bring that down to.
