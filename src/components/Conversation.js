              The time of your Bar Mitzvah is very important. It is when you are
              considered ready, beruchnius, to keep the entire Torah and
              mitzvos. Before the time of a Bar Mitzvah,a boy is still
              considered a Na’ar, a youth. He is not responsible for any
              mitzvos, except in a way of Chinuch, educational learning.
              <br /> For example, even though you are not mechuyav in kiddush
              until you are Bar Mitzvah, you have probably said it many times.
              This is because you were learning and practicing fot the “big
              game.” If keeping Torah and mitzvos during the years before a Bar
              Mitzvah is considered playing the little leagues, a Bar Mitzvah
              bochur is like an All Star player!
              <br /> Together with the readiness beruchnius for all the
              important jobs of a boy who is Bar Mitzvah, like being part of a
              minyan or putting on teffilin, come the changes that start
              happening begashmius which change a boy’s body from that of a
              child to an adult. The mitzvah of getting married, for example,
              requires an adult body. You may already know about many of these
              changes, or you may be learning about them for the first time.
              <br />
              <br />
              These changes are called puberty and they can begin to happen any
              time between the ages 10 to 15.{" "}
              <i>
                Binogaia our topic, yes that is the natural ages it can happen,
                but for most boys it starts anywhere from 12 to 13 1/2.
              </i>{" "}
              This is also referred to as the time of adolescence. Puberty may
              take a few years and sometimes longer. One bochur might grow a
              full beard in the time it takes for another bochur to just begin
              sprouting mustache hairs!
              <br /> <br />
              The time of puberty can be challenging, so being prepared can help
              you. It is important to understand and take care of your body, as
              well as to have people who can support you when you need them.
              Being close and open with your parents, having good friends and a
              rav who you can speak to are good tools for you to use as you go
              through these changes. You may be excited, nervous, confused or
              uncomfortable with all the changes that are happening. It can be
              helpful to remember that everyone goes through it (even your
              parents and friends!), and it is a challenging time for everyone.
              Everything that you are experiencing is normal and just another
              part of growing up.
              <br />
              Wishing you much hatzlacha!
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              Now let’s bring the first part of the conversation, from Rabbi
              Peysin’s book, which he has under the section titled: <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <span style={{ textAlign: "center !important" }}>
                <b> PUBIC CHANGES:</b>
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <br /> The scrotum (pouch of skin containing the testicles,
              Beyim), and the Beyim themselves will grow. It will grow larger,
              coarser, and darker. The Beyim will hang loosely down. Usually
              this occurs first, followed by growth of the Milah, which will
              become longer and thicker. This is one of the most important
              changes which will happen, and has the potential for the most
              kedusha. When a baby is born, males and females are generally
              identical except for one organ – one body part; the milah. In
              English, the milah is known as the penis. The very first mitzvah
              that you did was with your milah, having a Bris Milah. The tip of
              the milah used to be covered by a thick piece of skin, the orlah,
              known as the foreskin. At a bris, the thick skin is removed to
              reveal a softer more sensitive area of the milah. In a way, this
              refers to revealing a more refined part of the neshamah, making of
              more receptive and open to Hashem, Torah and Yiddishkeit. The
              milah is actually a very holy body part. In fact, according to the
              Zohar, before Adam Harishon did the Cheit Eitz Hadaas, a special
              light shone from the area of his milah. He was not ashamed of it.
              Cheit Eitz Hadaas caused him to feel uncomfortable with the
              private parts of his body, and he covered it. -See Zohar Aleph in
              the Hashmatos 16b, gimmel 306b. “Adam’s heel (referring to his
              milah) dulled the orb of the sun.”- The milah is the body part
              that is used as part of the process of having children. During
              puberty, the milah is preparing for its important job.{" "}
              <i>
                -Yes, this happens during puberty, not when, you’re a Chassan.
              </i>
              –
              <br /> <br />
              You make think that you’re a little young to be preparing for
              having children, but the chiyuv of marriage actually begins at Bar
              Mitzvah, along with other mitzvos!{" "}
              <i>
                {" "}
                -Like Pirya V’Rivya. According to most Rishonim, marriage and
                Pirya V’Rivya, are two different Mitzvos. –
              </i>
              Nowadays we don’t actually get married at this age, because we are
              busy studying Torah and preparing for marriage. So far in your
              life, you probably knew of only one thing that come from your
              milah, urine, also referred to as Ketanim – the waist fluids that
              your body gets rid of when you use the bathroom. However the milah
              is also the place that the Zera, semen, comes from. The word Zera
              literally means “seeds.” Imagine that creating a new baby was like
              planting something. A new plant needs lot of things to grow, like
              good soil, water and sunlight. The Zera of a male is like the seed
              that is planted for a new baby to grow. The word Zera is also used
              to mean “offspring” or the children that a person has, because
              that is what the Zera accomplishes. For example, we give people a
              brachah to have “Zar’a Chaya V’kayama,” “living and enduring
              children.” Zera is actually a combination of “sperm,” which are
              microscopic cells{" "}
              <i>
                -which when you look at it with a medical microscope, you can
                actually see body organs, like hands and feet, etc.-
              </i>{" "}
              and fluid. The zera appears to be a whitish, yellowish fluid that
              is somewhat thick and it comes out in the amount of about a
              teaspoon or more.{" "}
              <i>
                I think what he means is that everyman a male ejaculates, the
                zera comes out in the amount of about a teaspoon or more, at a
                time, not that that is the full ejaculation.
              </i>{" "}
              Zera is produced by the Beyim, testicles, which are enclosed in
              the scrotum with hangs beneath the milah. The task of zera is very
              valuable (it creates new Yiddishe children!), and this is one
              important reason we are very careful not to waste any of it. When
              Zera is wasted, even by accident, it is called Zera Levatalah,
              “wasted seeds.” Imagine if you were carrying a little handful of
              very rare and important seeds that were going to be used to plant
              a special fruit tree in the royal palace gardens. You certainly
              would be very careful not to spill or waste any of them! This
              topic will be discussed at length later.{" "}
              <i>And yes, we will be bringing down that section as well.</i>
              More frequently during puberty, the milah becomes hard. This
              happenes when blood rushes to that area, and causes what is called
              an erection, known as Kishui (hardness, from the word kasheh).
              Because of the hormones of puberty, this may happen by itself, but
              a bochur must take care not to cause it to happen deliberately.
              <i>
                Remember, this a very important part of the conversation. But it
                should only come from a place of love.
              </i>{" "}
              We will discuss some details and practical tips on this later.
              <i>
                Yes, he means the section that he wrote about before, which we
                said we will be bringing down. Now Rabbi Peysin’s next section
                is not as Nogeia for our conversation, but it is at least
                somewhat Nogeia, and it does give us a bit more of
                understanding,and it’s right after the previous section, so
                let’s bring that down to.

              <b>HOW DOES PUBERTY HAPPEN?</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Physically, during puberty, some important hormones are working in
              order for all the changes to happen. A hormone is a chemical that
              flows around the body through the blood and causes a change or
              effect in the body. One of the most important male hormones is
              testosterone (teh·staa·str·own). The brain sends a message to the
              beyim, which begin to produce testosterone. When the amount of
              testosterone in the body starts to rise, it causes the body to
              grow and change -It’s this hormone that also causes males (when
              they work out at least), to develop more and faster muscle growth
              that females. - and produce zera. Your doctor -remember he’s
              speaking to the boy directly, like you should do with your son.
              You can always phrase the conversation accordingly – can be a good
              resource to answer any of you questions about puberty and your
              changing body. - And absolutely, please encourage your son to do
              so, especially if it’s something you are not sure about,
              especially if he’s going for a physical, which the point of that
              is, to make sure his ENTIRE body is functioning properly. – If
              puberty begins to happen at a too early an age, around nine years
              old, or does not seem to begin by age fourteen, a doctor could
              determine if everything is normal. If you have any pain or
              swelling in parts of your body, or something just doesn’t feel
              right, don’t hesitate to ask your doctor about it. After all,
              that’s their job!

              Now let’s bring the section in Rabbi Peysin’s book titled: <br />
              <b>SHMIRAS HABRIS (GUARDING THEBRIS):</b> <br />
              <br /> The concept of Shmiras Habris, keeping your bris{" "}
              <i>(or milah -what Rabbi Peysin calls the male organ-)</i> holy
              includes the issur of Zera Levatalah, wasting zera. We mentioned
              before that zera is special and we take measures to try and not
              waste it. It is assur to waste zera by masturbating, which means
              stimulating{" "}
              <i>-getting it hard, somehow or another would be one example-</i>{" "}
              or touching the milah to cause zera to come out. The taavah
              (desire) for this can be very strong -Especially during PUBERTY,
              and even more so in the beginning-, which is a sign that your body
              is preparing for adulthood and marriage!{" "}
              <i>-And having children. –</i>
              Kishui -called an erection in English- always occurs before zera
              is released, but if someone has kishui <i>-they are hard-</i> for
              any reason, they can distract themselves and the kishui may go
              away on its own.{" "}
              <i>
                If your home alone, you can go into a different room (the
                Chassidishe Seforim say, sometimes it’s from the bad chochos in
                that room), and dance your heart out, is one idea. Another idea
                is pacing back and forth very quickly. And yet another idea, is
                breath in a breath out very slowly and calmly.
              </i>{" "}
              What you think, see, hear or talk can also make it hard to control
              the taavah for Zera Levatalah. <br />
              <br />
              Being that it can take some time to understand how your body
              works, most people make mistakes until they figure it out. That is
              why it is also called Chatas Ne’urim, the aveiros of youth, SINCE
              IT IS “SO” COMMON FOR YOUTH TO SLIP UP IN THIS AREA “AT LEAST
              ONCE”. Sometimes Zera will come out without you doing anything.
              When this happens at night while you are sleeping, it is called a
              Mikreh Lailah, “something that happens at night.” In English it is
              known as a “nocturnal emission” or{" "}
              <i>-what it is more commonly known as- a wet dream. </i>This is
              normal a normal occurrence and “happens to all young teenage boys,
              some more than others”. If this happens you can simply change your
              clothes and go back to sleep. You may feel more comfortable to do
              your own laundry for this reason. Although a Mikreh Lailah
              technically happens by itself, and the person may have not
              actually caused it, there are things that can help prevent it.
              Often, things that are thought about during the day and dreamed
              about at night, which may cause a Mikreh Lailah.{" "}
              <i>-Al tharair bayom v’lo yuvo l’ydai keri balalila. –</i>Having
              numerous instances of Mikreh Lailah could indicate that a lot of
              time is spent thinking certain thoughts. Following the advice of
              the Shulchan Aruch of which position to sleep in can also help
              prevent a Mikreh Lailah from happening.
              <br />
              <br /> Being tempted to do things which lead to Zera Levatalah is
              part of “puberty” and the growth process of becoming an adult. It
              is very normal to be interested in such things, and these feelings
              are part of every person’s body, in the same way you get hungry or
              sleepy!{" "}
              <i>
                -And if these feelings are not part of a person’s body,
                especially a boy going through puberty, as we have mentioned
                before he honestly need a psychiatrist –{" "}
              </i>
              The Torah says “Bocheh Lemishpechosav”, that the Yidden cried when
              Moshe commanded them about these things, because they knew ho hard
              it is to control yourself! It may the most difficult thing you do
              in your life. There are a number of resources that speak about the
              issur of Hotzaas Zera Levatalah, such as Shulchan Aruch, Rambam,
              -Zohar- and Gemara. You may want to look these up yourself or
              learn them with your father or rav.
              <i>
                {" "}
                Remember Rabbi Peysin is talking to the kid straight. But if you
                are the one having this conversation with the kid. You should
                know the kid well enough (that’s another reason, his parents are
                the best option), to know the balance between teaching how
                Chumer this is and still understanding what he’s going through
                both from a Ruchnius’dge and Gashmius’dge preservice. An again

              or at least with the door open. <br />
              <br />
              Do lots of activities! Exercise, hobbies, sports, spending time
              with friends-clean ones-, doing schoolwork and getting involved in
              chessed projects all help you keep your mind on more appropriate
              things.
              <br />
              <br /> Of course, keeping your mind on Torah, which should be your
              most important goal during these years, is a great protection for
              yourself. <br />
              <br />
              Staying in a tznius environment, and avoiding certain book or
              videos is very helpful.
              <br />
              <br /> If you know of things and feelings that cause you to have
              thoughts that may lead to Zera Levatalah, those are the things you
              should stay away from! <br />
              <br />
              Choose your friends. Spend time with people that encourage
              personal kedusha and influence you in a positive way. <br />
              <br />
              Adding in Yiddishkeit by davening better, and even checking your
              mezuzos and tefillin can protect you. <br />
              <br />
              There is also an idea of saying the first four perakim of tehillim
              before going to sleep. <br />
              <br />
              Each time that you are successful in maintaining your personal
              tahara should encourage you. <br />
              <br />
              It is not possible to promise yourself that you will never make a
              mistake; trying to be ALWAYS perfect can make you too nervous to
              succeed each individual time! Take it just one step at a time.{" "}
              <br />
              <br />
              If you make a mistake, you don’t have to start all over again or
              feel bad; “just try again”.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is well-known that when Hashem wanted to give the Torah to the
              Yidden, the malochim claimed that they should receive it because
              they are so holy and could appreciate it more. <br />
              <br />
              However, Moshe Rabbeinu argued successfully that they wouldn’t
              actually be able to keep the mitzvos! <br />
              <br />
              If the malochim had the Torah, they would ever have made mistakes.
              Instead, Hashem gave the Torah and mitzvos to us, and we are not
              perfect like malochim! <br />
              <br />
              Because it is a struggle for us to keep the mitzvos, each time we
              do the right thing we give Hashem much joy and should feel a sense
              of accomplishment! <br />
              <br />
              The struggle each person has with Shmiras Habris is individual and
              private. It is something you may want to discuss with a “trusted”
              rav, older sibling.
